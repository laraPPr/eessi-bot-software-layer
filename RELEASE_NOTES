This is the first release of the EESSI build-and-deploy bot, which consists of
an event handler (implemented as a GitHub app, see https://docs.github.com/en/apps),
and a job manager component (implemented as Python script).

It provides support for:

* building software via jobs submitted to a Slurm cluster;
* building software for a GitHub repository that includes a `bot/build.sh` and `bot/check-build.sh` script;
* acting on certain GitHub events:
  * opening of pull requests;
  * pull request comment being posted that include bot commands (like `help`, `build`, `show_config`);
  * labeling of pull requests;
* status updates of build jobs via pull request comments;
* access control for sending commands, submitting build jobs, triggering deploys via GitHub accounts;
* uploading of tarballs with built software artefacts to an S3 bucket;
* wide range of configuration settings to run the bot in different Slurm-based environments;

Multiple bot instances can be run in parallel for a single GitHub repository.
