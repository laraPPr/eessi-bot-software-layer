# ASSUMPTIONs:
#  - working directory has been prepared by the bot with a checkout of a
#    pull request (OR by some other means)
#  - the working directory contains a directory 'cfg' where the main config
#    file 'job.cfg' has been deposited
#  - the directory may contain any additional files references in job.cfg,
#    for example, repos.cfg and configuration file bundles for repositories
